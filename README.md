## EmotionScanner-Backend

Welcome to the EmotionScanner-Backend Repository, an integral part of my thesis project developed during my academic studies. This backend system is designed for an advanced emotion recognition application that uses machine learning and image processing to classify facial expressions into specific emotions.

### Key Features

- **Emotion Recognition**: Utilizes deep learning models for accurate emotion identification from facial images.
- **API Integration**: Provides a RESTful API for smooth communication with the frontend, enabling real-time emotion analysis.
- **Data Processing**: Incorporates effective image processing and augmentation to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Features diverse machine learning models with comprehensive optimization for peak performance.

### Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Backend Framework**: Flask
- **Data Management**: pandas, NumPy, OpenCV

### Quick Start

Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Follow these steps to set up the backend:

1. Clone the backend repository:

       git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/EmotionScanner-Backend.git

2. Install dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask app:

        python app.py
   
The backend service will start, and can be accessed to process image data for emotion recognition.

Note: This repository contains only the backend part of the EmotionScanner project. The frontend, responsible for the user interface and interaction, is hosted in a separate repository: EmotionScanner-Frontend.
